## About Me

Hello, World! My name is Matthew, and I am an Indie iOS Developer with two years of experience and from Vancouver, Canada. I have previously worked in the EV industry, and my interests are in the crypto space, creating electronic music, and learning more about software development. Also, I am a former world-class competitive bagpiper and have performed in Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, France, the United States of America, Japan and my home country of Canada.

iOS Development is not my first career, and I say this because some may notice that I have grey in my beard, and I have challenges growing my hair on the top of my head. If you guessed that I am not 29 years old, then you guessed correctly, and I did start to learn code later in life and found out that I have a passion for it. I love the challenge of solving problems and figuring out how to make things work. It isn't always easy, but pushing through and coming up with solutions to problems is a much better feeling than giving up.

Thankfully I know where to get support if I need it, and some of the online communities I belong to are; iOS Folks, iOS Developers, and iOS Dev Happy Hour. Recently, I started to get into podcasts, and some I like to listen to so far are Core Intuition, The iPhreaks Show, and Inside iOS Dev and if you know of any good ones, please feel free to reach out and let me know! 

Lastly, I am currently looking for my next opportunity and for a role on a great team that collaborates on problems, has pair programming opportunities, mentorship, room for growth and where I can have an impact. If you know of any iOS Developer opportunities that you might think I would be a good fit for, please reach out because I would love to hear about them. 

Thanks,
Matthew

p.s. If you are just getting started in your iOS journey, please reach out, and I will do my best to answer any questions you have or point you in the right direction.
